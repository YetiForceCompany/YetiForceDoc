Widgets in YetiForce are interactive elements that can be placed on the system dashboard. They allow quick access to the most important information and functions, as well as customization of the user interface according to individual needs.

The main purpose of using widgets in YetiForce is:

- **Increasing Productivity**: Widgets allow users to quickly access key information and features without having to navigate through extensive menus.
- **Ui Customization**: Users can select and arrange widgets on the dashboard to suit their preferences and the way they work.
- **Access to real-time data**: Many widgets display up-to-date data such as lead count, task status, and more.
- **Easy navigation**: Widgets can be used as shortcuts to frequently used modules or system functions.

Some widgets are predefined and ready to use right away. However, if you need to display non-standard data, you can create a widget according to your own preferences.
