## How to register YetiForce?

The [YetiForce Public License](/introduction/license-open-source) requires YetiForce to be registered. Registration is also necessary if you want to purchase products or services from the Marketplace. There are two ways to properly register your system.

Below you can find step-by-step instructions on how to register YetiForce using the online registration form built into the system.

If the system you are registering has access to the Internet, please use the online registration method according to the instructions below. If your system does not connect to the Internet, the instructions and required information for offline registration can be found in the [license](/introduction/license-open-source).

:::warning

All keys are generated after verifying the information provided in the registration form. We verify the information manually, therefore the proces may take up to 48 hours. Sending an offline registration request will not speed up online registration.

:::

Go to system settings by clicking the cogwheel button in the upper right corner.

Read the information at the top of the page and fill in all mandatory fields (marked with a red asterisk) with real details of your company.

Providing fake information will result in the registration being rejected.

For a detailed description of the fields, see the [Form fields](administrator-guides/company/company-details/#form-fields) section below.

## Check status

If the registration status has not been updated in your system automatically after a couple of days, you can refresh it manually. In order to do that, click the `Check status` button. The status will be refreshed immediately, and the update time in the upper right corner should change to `a moment ago.` If it doesn't, the [following article](administrator-guides/company/problems-with-system-registration/) will help you troubleshoot registration issues.
