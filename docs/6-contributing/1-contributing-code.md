## Send pull requests

You can send us bug fixes, modifications, or entire functionalities using [Pull Requests](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM/pulls). You can also review Pull Requests submitted by others and comment on them. If you want to find out more about Pull Requests, please take a look at the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

YetiForce programmers will first review and verify the code you send us, and then, if all the conditions are met, merge your Pull Request. Sending Pull Requests requires signing a CLA.
