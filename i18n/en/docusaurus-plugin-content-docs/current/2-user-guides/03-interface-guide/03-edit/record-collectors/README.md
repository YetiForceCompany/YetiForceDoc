Record collector is used to load data from various sources and enables displaying and loading data into the YetiForce CRM system.

The mechanism is available in all modules, however it has to be enabled and configured for each module to work correctly.

## Configuration

When configuring a **record collector**, you must first grant the necessary permissions to the relevant roles in the system. For details, see the article: [Record collector permissions](/administrator-guides/integration/record-collectors/).

Then go to the administration section and select `Integration ‚Üí Record Collectors`. After opening the tab, a list of available collectors will be displayed.

A list of available collectors will appear at the bottom, next to the Save and Cancel buttons. Collectors marked in the administration section as **Featured** will be displayed as separate icons next to the list. Other active collectors are available under the <kbd>Record collectors</kbd> button. After clicking this button, a list of active, non-featured collectors will be displayed.

Collectors can also be accessed from "Quick Create" forms. They appear at the top right in popup windows, as shown in the screenshot below.
