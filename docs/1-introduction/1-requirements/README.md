## Introduction

YetiForce CRM requires a proper web server configuration. It is a key element for the process of installation as well as for the system to be stable. Most professional web servers meet the requirements presented below. However, in case your server does not meet all the requirements, ask your administrator to adjust the configuration and send him a link to this article. If your administrator cannot change the configuration, it might be time to consider upgrading your server.

During the installation process, the system verifies the actual server configuration and shows the elements that are incorrect and require a change in parameters. Please note that the requirements presented below are not general and not for each installation, for more complex systems they should be verified and optimized individually.

:::tip
The most recent and complete configuration can be found in the module [Server Configuration](/administrator-guides/logs/server-configuration/) in the demo version:

- https://demo.yetiforce.com/index.php?parent=Settings&module=ConfReport&view=Index&block=14&fieldid=65
:::

:::warning
The requirements vary depending on the version of YetiForce. Check the requirements for the version you are installing before you begin.

## Possible issues

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

## Core server software (LAMP/LEMP)

- **Operating system - Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Mint** - works on most Linux distributions. We don't recommend the MS Windows operating system as well as MS Windows Server. Our system works well on Windows servers, however, it's not an optimal environment in terms of web applications.

  :::warning
  
  Due to security reasons, we recommend running each version of the YetiForce system (PROD and TEST) on a separate/dedicated user of the operating system (preferably on a separate server), e.g. yfprod, yftest. We do not recommend using one operating system user for several applications/websites.
  
  :::

- **Serwer WWW**

  - **Nginx `1.23` (recommended)** - works on earlier versions as well, however, the latest stable versions are recommended. You can also use alternative software as long as it is compatible.
  - **Apache `2.4`** - works on earlier versions as well (`2.1, 2.2, 2.3`), however, the latest stable versions are recommended. You can also use alternative software as long as it is compatible.

    :::warning
 
    The system does not work with the ModSecurity web server extension
    
    :::

- **Databases**

  - **MariaDB `10.6` (recommended)** - we recommend the latest stable versions. We don't recommend versions older than `10.1`.
  - **MySQL `8.0.13`** or later. We recommend the latest stable versions.

- **PHP `8.1, 8.2, 8.3` (recommended)**. The latest stable versions are recommended (eg. `8.3.x`).

## Database engine requirements (MariaDB/MySQL)

Configuration files eg. `/etc/my.cnf`, `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`, `/etc/mysql/conf.d/`, `my.ini`

- `SQL_MODE` should not contain `STRICT_TRANS_TABLE` i `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`
- `ENGINE = InnoDB` should be available and enabled by default (disable --skip-innodb)

:::warning
Ze względów bezpieczeństwa zalecamy aby każda baza danych posiadała dedykowanego użytkownika, nie zalecamy używania użytkownika bazodanowego `root` do komunikacji z bazą danych.

FPM configuration example:
<details>
  <summary>Latest stable version</summary>

```ini
; Start a new pool named 'www'.
; the variable $pool can be used in any directive and will be replaced by the
; pool name ('www' here)
[yfprod]

; Per pool prefix
; It only applies on the following directives:
; - 'access.log'
; - 'slowlog'
; - 'listen' (unixsocket)
; - 'chroot'
; - 'chdir'
; - 'php_values'
; - 'php_admin_values'
; When not set, the global prefix (or /usr) applies instead.
; Note: This directive can also be relative to the global prefix.
; Default Value: none
;prefix = /path/to/pools/$pool

; Unix user/group of processes
; Note: The user is mandatory. If the group is not set, the default user's group
;       will be used.
user = yfprod
group = yfprod

; The address on which to accept FastCGI requests.
; Valid syntaxes are:
;   'ip.add.re.ss:port'    - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific IPv4 address on
;                            a specific port;
;   '[ip:6:addr:ess]:port' - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific IPv6 address on
;                            a specific port;
;   'port'                 - to listen on a TCP socket to all addresses
;                            (IPv6 and IPv4-mapped) on a specific port;
;   '/path/to/unix/socket' - to listen on a unix socket.
; Note: This value is mandatory.
listen = /run/php/yfprod.sock

; Set listen(2) backlog.
; Default Value: 511 (-1 on FreeBSD and OpenBSD)
;listen.backlog = 511

; Set permissions for unix socket, if one is used. In Linux, read/write
; permissions must be set in order to allow connections from a web server. Many
; BSD-derived systems allow connections regardless of permissions. The owner
; and group can be specified either by name or by their numeric IDs.
; Default Values: user and group are set as the running user
;                 mode is set to 0660
listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data
;listen.mode = 0660
; When POSIX Access Control Lists are supported you can set them using
; these options, value is a comma separated list of user/group names.
; When set, listen.owner and listen.group are ignored
;listen.acl_users =
;listen.acl_groups =

; List of addresses (IPv4/IPv6) of FastCGI clients which are allowed to connect.
; Equivalent to the FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS environment variable in the original
; PHP FCGI (5.2.2+). Makes sense only with a tcp listening socket. Each address
; must be separated by a comma. If this value is left blank, connections will be
; accepted from any ip address.
; Default Value: any
;listen.allowed_clients = 127.0.0.1

; Specify the nice(2) priority to apply to the pool processes (only if set)
; The value can vary from -19 (highest priority) to 20 (lower priority)
; Note: - It will only work if the FPM master process is launched as root
;       - The pool processes will inherit the master process priority
;         unless it specified otherwise
; Default Value: no set
; process.priority = -19

; Set the process dumpable flag (PR_SET_DUMPABLE prctl) even if the process user
; or group is differrent than the master process user. It allows to create process
; core dump and ptrace the process for the pool user.
; Default Value: no
; process.dumpable = yes

; Choose how the process manager will control the number of child processes.
; Possible Values:
;   static  - a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes;
;   dynamic - the number of child processes are set dynamically based on the
;             following directives. With this process management, there will be
;             always at least 1 children.
;             pm.max_children      - the maximum number of children that can
;                                    be alive at the same time.
;             pm.start_servers     - the number of children created on startup.
;             pm.min_spare_servers - the minimum number of children in 'idle'
;                                    state (waiting to process). If the number
;                                    of 'idle' processes is less than this
;                                    number then some children will be created.
;             pm.max_spare_servers - the maximum number of children in 'idle'
;                                    state (waiting to process). If the number
;                                    of 'idle' processes is greater than this
;                                    number then some children will be killed.
;  ondemand - no children are created at startup. Children will be forked when
;             new requests will connect. The following parameter are used:
;             pm.max_children           - the maximum number of children that
;                                         can be alive at the same time.
;             pm.process_idle_timeout   - The number of seconds after which
;                                         an idle process will be killed.
; Note: This value is mandatory.
pm = ondemand

; The number of child processes to be created when pm is set to 'static' and the
; maximum number of child processes when pm is set to 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'.
; This value sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be
; served. Equivalent to the ApacheMaxClients directive with mpm_prefork.
; Equivalent to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable in the original PHP
; CGI. The below defaults are based on a server without much resources. Don't
; forget to tweak pm.* to fit your needs.
; Note: Used when pm is set to 'static', 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'
; Note: This value is mandatory.
pm.max_children = 15

; The number of child processes created on startup.
; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'
; Default Value: (min_spare_servers + max_spare_servers) / 2
pm.start_servers = 2

; The desired minimum number of idle server processes.
; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'
; Note: Mandatory when pm is set to 'dynamic'
pm.min_spare_servers = 1

; The desired maximum number of idle server processes.
; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'
; Note: Mandatory when pm is set to 'dynamic'
pm.max_spare_servers = 3

; The number of seconds after which an idle process will be killed.
; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'ondemand'
; Default Value: 10s
;pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s;

; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.
; This can be useful to work around memory leaks in 3rd party libraries. For
; endless request processing specify '0'. Equivalent to PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS.
; Default Value: 0
;pm.max_requests = 500

; The URI to view the FPM status page. If this value is not set, no URI will be
; recognized as a status page. It shows the following informations:
;   pool                 - the name of the pool;
;   process manager      - static, dynamic or ondemand;
;   start time           - the date and time FPM has started;
;   start since          - number of seconds since FPM has started;
;   accepted conn        - the number of request accepted by the pool;
;   listen queue         - the number of request in the queue of pending
;                          connections (see backlog in listen(2));
;   max listen queue     - the maximum number of requests in the queue
;                          of pending connections since FPM has started;

;   max children reached - number of times, the process limit has been reached,
;                          when pm tries to start more children (works only for
;                          pm 'dynamic' and 'ondemand');
; Value are updated in real time.
; Example output:
;   pool:                 www

;
; By default the status page output is formatted as text/plain. Passing either
; 'html', 'xml' or 'json' in the query string will return the corresponding
; output syntax. Example:
;   http://www.foo.bar/status
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml
;
; By default the status page only outputs short status. Passing 'full' in the
; query string will also return status for each pool process.
; Example:
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?full
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json&full
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html&full
;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml&full
; The Full status returns for each process:
;   pid                  - the PID of the process;
;   state                - the state of the process (Idle, Running, ...);

;   request duration     - the duration in µs of the requests;
;   request method       - the request method (GET, POST, ...);
;   request URI          - the request URI with the query string;
;   content length       - the content length of the request (only with POST);
;   user                 - the user (PHP_AUTH_USER) (or '-' if not set);
;   script               - the main script called (or '-' if not set);
;   last request cpu     - the %cpu the last request consumed
;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request
;                          processing has terminated;
;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed
;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state
;                          because memory calculation is done when the request
;                          processing has terminated;
; If the process is in Idle state, then informations are related to the

;      e.g. for a ISO8601 formatted timestring, use: %{%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z}t
;  %T: time the log has been written (the request has finished)
;      it can accept a strftime(3) format:
;      %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z (default)
;      The strftime(3) format must be encapsuled in a %{<strftime_format>}t tag
;      e.g. for a ISO8601 formatted timestring, use: %{%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z}t

;
; Default: "%R - %u %t \"%m %r\" %s"
;access.format = "%R - %u %t \"%m %r%Q%q\" %s %f %{mili}d %{kilo}M %C%%"

; The log file for slow requests
; Default Value: not set
; Note: slowlog is mandatory if request_slowlog_timeout is set
;slowlog = log/$pool.log.slow

; The timeout for serving a single request after which a PHP backtrace will be
; dumped to the 'slowlog' file. A value of '0s' means 'off'.
; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)
; Default Value: 0
;request_slowlog_timeout = 0

; Depth of slow log stack trace.
; Default Value: 20
;request_slowlog_trace_depth = 20

; The timeout for serving a single request after which the worker process will
; be killed. This option should be used when the 'max_execution_time' ini option
; does not stop script execution for some reason. A value of '0' means 'off'.
; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)
; Default Value: 0
;request_terminate_timeout = 0

; The timeout set by 'request_terminate_timeout' ini option is not engaged after
; application calls 'fastcgi_finish_request' or when application has finished and
; shutdown functions are being called (registered via register_shutdown_function).
; This option will enable timeout limit to be applied unconditionally
; even in such cases.
; Default Value: no
;request_terminate_timeout_track_finished = no

; Set open file descriptor rlimit.
; Default Value: system defined value
;rlimit_files = 1024

; Set max core size rlimit.
; Possible Values: 'unlimited' or an integer greater or equal to 0
; Default Value: system defined value
;rlimit_core = 0

; Chroot to this directory at the start. This value must be defined as an
; absolute path. When this value is not set, chroot is not used.
; Note: you can prefix with '$prefix' to chroot to the pool prefix or one
; of its subdirectories. If the pool prefix is not set, the global prefix
; will be used instead.
; Note: chrooting is a great security feature and should be used whenever
;       possible. However, all PHP paths will be relative to the chroot
;       (error_log, sessions.save_path, ...).
; Default Value: not set
;chroot =

; Chdir to this directory at the start.
; Note: relative path can be used.
; Default Value: current directory or / when chroot
;chdir = /var/www

; Redirect worker stdout and stderr into main error log. If not set, stdout and
; stderr will be redirected to /dev/null according to FastCGI specs.
; Note: on highloaded environement, this can cause some delay in the page
; process time (several ms).
; Default Value: no
;catch_workers_output = yes

; Decorate worker output with prefix and suffix containing information about
; the child that writes to the log and if stdout or stderr is used as well as
; log level and time. This options is used only if catch_workers_output is yes.
; Settings to "no" will output data as written to the stdout or stderr.
; Default value: yes
;decorate_workers_output = no

; Clear environment in FPM workers
; Prevents arbitrary environment variables from reaching FPM worker processes
; by clearing the environment in workers before env vars specified in this
; pool configuration are added.
; Setting to "no" will make all environment variables available to PHP code
; via getenv(), $_ENV and $_SERVER.
; Default Value: yes
;clear_env = no

; Limits the extensions of the main script FPM will allow to parse. This can
; prevent configuration mistakes on the web server side. You should only limit
; FPM to .php extensions to prevent malicious users to use other extensions to
; execute php code.
; Note: set an empty value to allow all extensions.
; Default Value: .php
;security.limit_extensions = .php .php3 .php4 .php5 .php7

; Pass environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH. All $VARIABLEs are taken from
; the current environment.
; Default Value: clean env
;env[HOSTNAME] = $HOSTNAME
;env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
;env[TMP] = /tmp
;env[TMPDIR] = /tmp
;env[TEMP] = /tmp

; Additional php.ini defines, specific to this pool of workers. These settings
; overwrite the values previously defined in the php.ini. The directives are the
; same as the PHP SAPI:
;   php_value/php_flag             - you can set classic ini defines which can
;                                    be overwritten from PHP call 'ini_set'.
;   php_admin_value/php_admin_flag - these directives won't be overwritten by
;                                     PHP call 'ini_set'
; For php_*flag, valid values are on, off, 1, 0, true, false, yes or no.

; Defining 'extension' will load the corresponding shared extension from
; extension_dir. Defining 'disable_functions' or 'disable_classes' will not
; overwrite previously defined php.ini values, but will append the new value
; instead.

; Note: path INI options can be relative and will be expanded with the prefix
; (pool, global or /usr)

; Default Value: nothing is defined by default except the values in php.ini and
;                specified at startup with the -d argument
;php_admin_value[sendmail_path] = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i -f www@my.domain.com

### HTTPS & HTTP2 encryption

We recommend encrypting the connection to the server where the system is located. If the connection to the server is not established via HTTPS, the communication can be intercepted or altered by third parties.

### Permissions to folders and files

Permissions to folders and files are often the most common source of problems for people who install an application on VPS and dedicated servers. There should be the same owner for all application files and folders.

We recommend the following configuration:

- files `644` (rw-r--r--)
- folders `755` (rwxr-xr-x)

The configuration should allow the uploaded files to have full read and write access at the browser level, without changing the file and folder permissions. It is necessary to remember that when the application is running, it also performs various operations such as reading and writing, as well as creating and deleting files. If you don't know how to configure the permissions, ask your administrator to do it and send them a link to this article.

- Configuration directory `config/`
- Application data directory `app_data/`
- User privileges directory `user_privileges/`
- Tabdata File `user_privileges/tabdata.php`
- Menu file `user_privileges/menu_0.php`
- User privileges file `user_privileges/user_privileges_1.php`
- Cache Directory `cache/`
- Address book directory `cache/addressBook/`
- Image Cache Directory `cache/images/`
- Import Cache Directory `cache/import/`
- Logs directory `cache/logs/`
- Session directory `cache/session/`
- Cache templates directory `cache/templates_c/`
- Cache upload directory `cache/upload/`
- Vtlib test directory `cache/vtlib/`
- Vtlib Test HTML Directory `cache/vtlib/HTML/`
- Cron modules directory `cron/modules/`
- Modules Directory `modules/`
- Storage Directory `storage/`
- Product Image Directory `storage/products/`
- User Image Directory `storage/users/`
- Contact Image Directory `storage/contacts/`
- MailView attachments directory `storage/OSSMailView/`
- Logo Directory `public_html/layouts/resources/Logo/`
- E-mail client `public_html/modules/OSSMail/`
- Third party libraries `public_html/libraries/`

### Issues with SELinux

:::warning
Permission issues occur frequently if SELinux is installed on the server and the enforcing mode is enabled. Note the parameters below:

- httpd_unified
- httpd_can_network_connect

https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-nginx-plus-with-selinux/

https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/selinux_configuration.html

https://www.getpagespeed.com/server-setup/nginx/nginx-selinux-configuration

```bash
sudo setsebool -P httpd_unified 1
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```

:::

## End user requirements

- OS - any OS that supports a web browser
- Display: 1280 × 800 (recommended)
- Browser compatible with `ES5` ([ECMAScript 5](https://caniuse.com/?search=es5)), and from YetiForce version 6.3 on `ES6` ([ECMAScript 6](https://caniuse.com/?search=es6))

### Supported browsers

Users should always have the latest version of any browsers they use because only the most recent versions support the newest web technologies. Below is a list of browsers, starting from the one that is the most recommended for YetiForce (Google Chrome) to the least recommended.

1. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge
2. Firefox
3. Opera, Brave, Vivaldi
4. Apple Safari
5. Internet Explorer
6. Other

## Additional configuration using .htaccess

Some servers allow changing the configuration via the `.htaccess` file. We present some of the examples below.

#### Apache module

:::warning
The configuration below works only if Apache (eg. `httpd.conf`) is set to "AllowOverride Options" or "AllowOverride All"
:::

```apacheconf
<IfModule mod_php5.c>
	php_flag	log_errors				On
	php_flag	display_errors			Off
	php_value	error_log				cache/logs/phpError.log
	php_value	memory_limit			512M
	php_flag	output_buffering		On
	php_flag	zlib.output_compression	Off
	php_flag	file_uploads			On
	php_value	upload_max_filesize		100M
	php_value	post_max_size			50M
</IfModule>
## FastCGI module
<IfModule fcgid_module.c>
	FcgidIOTimeout		600
	FcgidConnectTimeout	600
	FcgidBusyTimeout	600
	FcgidIdleTimeout	600
</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
	IdleTimeout			600
	ProcessLifeTime		600
	IPCConnectTimeout	600
	IPCCommTimeout		600
	BusyTimeout			600
</IfModule>
```

## Additional configuration using user.ini

You can also quickly change the PHP configuration by creating a user.ini file in the main directory `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`, right now it supports CGI/FastCGI. However, be careful because not all parameters can be configured this way (https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.modes.php).

More information: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php

Example:

<details>
  <summary>.user.ini</summary>

```ini
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
html_errors = On
log_errors = On
display_errors = Off
max_execution_time = 600
max_input_time = 600
default_socket_timeout = 600
output_buffering = "On"
post_max_size = 50M
upload_max_filesize = 100M
max_input_vars = 10000
memory_limit = 1024M
short_open_tag = "On"
default_charset = "UTF-8"
auto_detect_line_endings = "On"
zlib.output_compression = "Off"
session.cookie_httponly = "On"
session.auto_start = "Off"
session.gc_maxlifetime = 1440
session.gc_divisor = 500
session.gc_probability = 1
session.use_strict_mode = "On"
session.use_trans_sid = "Off"
session.use_only_cookies = "On"
session.name = "YTSID"
opcache.validate_timestamps = 1
opcache.revalidate_freq = 0
opcache.file_update_protection = 0
request_order = "GP"
variables_order = "GPCS"
```
