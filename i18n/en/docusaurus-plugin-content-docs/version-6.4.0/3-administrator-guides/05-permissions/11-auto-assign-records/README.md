## Configuration

The following settings blocks are available in the panel:

- **Conditions for the record** - setting the conditions that the record must meet in order for it to be automatically assigned;
- **Users to be assigned** - including the default option when none of the set users meets the availability criteria;
- **Conditions for user selection** - which constitute the basis for the selection of previously selected users. There are currently two selection methods available: _Load Balanced, Round Robin_.

## Description

In the first section of the settings there are three places where automatic assignment process can be started.

- **AVAILABLE WORKFLOW** Selecting this option will make it available in workflow actions, which will enable e.g. automatic assignment of already existing entries.

- **ACTIVE - BEFORE SAVE** The option activates automatic record assignment only for newly created records, i.e. before their creation.

- **AVAILABLE IN GUI** This option allows you to manually assign a record. If all the conditions are met, i.e. the criteria set for the record and the permission to the automatic assignment action has been granted in the profile of a given user, the manual assignment button will appear on the record preview.
