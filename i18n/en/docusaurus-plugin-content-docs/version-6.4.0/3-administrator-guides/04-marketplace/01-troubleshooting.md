The article below explains troubleshooting inactive or malfunctioning addons purchased in the Marketplace.

## Update registration status

YetiForce must be correctly registered in order for the Marketplace and purchased addons to work properly. If your registration is still pending even though you provided all the necessary information during the registration process you can refresh your registration status by clicking the `Check status` button in [`System settings → Company → Company`](/administrator-guides/company/company-details/#check-status) details.

- More information about registration can be found in the [How to register YetiForce?](/administrator-guides/company/company-details/#how-to-register-yetiforce) manual.
- In case of problems with registration you can find help in the [Problems with registration guide](/administrator-guides/company/problems-with-system-registration/).

## Check if YetiForce is up to date and fully patched.

Updates fix issues reported by the community and our employees that's why it's crucial to keep your system up to date.

- More information about the update process can be found in the [System update](/administrator-guides/logs/updates/) article.
- A complete list of patches can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM/releases) tab in our GitHub repository.

## Check server configuration.

Misconfiguration of the server impacts the whole system and can lead to a variety of unpredictable problems, including issues with obtaining information about active subscriptions and purchases.

More information about server requirements and configuration can be found in the following articles: [YetiForce requirements](/introduction/requirements/) and [Server - configuration](/administrator-guides/logs/server-configuration).

## Enable logs

Enable PHP, system, and web server logs and make sure the communication with yetiforce.com server is working. It's important to enable PHP logs so that the system can record error messages.
