## Test the software and report bugs

You can test our [development version](https://gitdeveloper.yetiforce.com) and report all problems you find using the [Issues tab](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM/issues) in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM).

Remember that system testing and bug reporting is also considered contribution to the development of the system, because if we don't know that there is a bug, we can't fix it.
