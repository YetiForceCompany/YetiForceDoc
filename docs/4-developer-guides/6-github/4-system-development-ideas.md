Users often submit their ideas for new YetiForce functionalities. We have absolutely nothing against this practice, although most of these submissions will be ignored. However, it doesn't mean that these ideas are bad. This article explains why adding new features might turn out to be problematic.

## 1. Number of ideas vs. the reality

The YetiForce team has been dealing with Vtiger (in the past) and YetiForce (currently) for many years. Being familiar with the system and working with it makes us aware of all the elements that can be improved. Every member of the team has at least a couple of ideas daily how to change the system, and that's truly amazing! The situation is similar when it comes to the community - the more they get to know the system, the more they understand the system, and as a result the better their ideas are. In practice this means that if we made a list of all the ideas related to YetiForce's development, we'd add hundreds of ideas weekly.

The reality is that we have limited human resources to implement new features. The changes ordered by our clients are our priority, because they are the reason why YetiForce is so versatile and develops so quickly.

## 2. Who can add new features?

Sometimes the community tends to forget about the key feature of YetiForce - namely about the fact that it's an open source system. Every company and every user can contribute to the system's development in several different ways, for example by adding new features. We have to remember that working together allows us to achieve much more than working independently. If our team doesn't have enough time to add a certain feature right away, then each and every single one of you can either write it, or order it from any other company, and send to us.

## 3. Ignored ideas

Rejecting an idea that was submitted to our GitHub repository doesn't mean that this particular idea is bad. It only means that we don't have enough time to take care of it. To keep order in our repository we don't want the rejected ideas to stay opened, instead we will label them as:

- Category::Enhancement
- Category::Ignored

All of these ideas can be reviewed in our GitHub repository at any time, and - if possible - implemented later on.
