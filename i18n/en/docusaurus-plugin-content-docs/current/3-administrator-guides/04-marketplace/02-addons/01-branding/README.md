The Disable Branding add-on allows for more extensive customization of the YetiForce system's appearance. It allows you to insert your company data into the footer and set your own links to social media profiles.

### Features

- Remove YetiForce social media links from the footer and replace them with your own links
- Remove information about the software producer from the footer
- Remove YetiForce footer from system emails
- Remove YetiForce footer from PDF printouts

Keep in mind that this service is not a replacement for the so-called “white labeling” and will not completely remove all information about the system producer from the system.

### Customize information in the footer

Company branding data is set by selecting `System Tools → System - Configuration` from the left menu in the administration section. Then select the **Branding Data** tab. Here, you will be able to set the values ​​that will appear in the footer of the page. Social media icons will not appear in the footer if the links are empty.
