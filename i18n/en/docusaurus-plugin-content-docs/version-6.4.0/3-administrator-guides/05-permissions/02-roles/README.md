In the system, there is a built-in Roles module that allows for mapping the company's organizational structure. The mechanism can reflect even the most complex structure. In order to configure this module, you need to go to "Software configuration" and select "Permissions" and "Roles".

To begin with, we will use an example of an organization that has a CEO at the top and a director lower in the hierarchy, then three managers with one employee each. This a simple example of a structure, but in YetiForce there are no limitations as to the number of levels you may add.
