The Kanban board is a tool used mainly for project management, but in YetiForce CRM this view is available in all user modules where data is stored. Kanban helps visualize data by grouping them in various ways, effectively define the amount of work in progress and increase efficiency

:::warning

The Kanban board is a paid addon available in the Marketplace in your YetiForce system.
