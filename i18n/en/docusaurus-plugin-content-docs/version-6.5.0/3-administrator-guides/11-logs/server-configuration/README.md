The server configuration panel is a place where you can preview the settings of all the parameters of a server where the system is located.

The functionality can be extremely useful, especially if you experience system errors – the server configuration panel will highlight in red all the parameters and settings that don’t meet YetiForce’s requirements.

Apart from the functions listed above, for our users’ convenience, the panel has been expanded by the following options:

## Download configuration

Allows you to save the entire configuration together with the items highlighted in red as a .png file. Thanks to this solution you can quickly download and send the file to the appropriate specialist to analyze.
