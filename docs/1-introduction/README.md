## About us

YetiForce is open source software used to manage customer relationships and support business processes that take place in all companies.

All products and services sold in our Marketplace are completely optional and not necessary for the system to work properly. There are no differences between the system we install for our paying customers and the system you can install on your own server - they are identical and include the same number of functionalities.
